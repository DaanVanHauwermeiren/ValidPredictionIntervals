# ValidPredictionIntervals
Contains the code to run the different models considered in the paper "Valid prediction intervals for regression problems" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00363)

In the future, further support for conditional conformal prediction might be added. Currently some functionality is already present, but this is not complete.
