# ValidPredictionIntervals
Contains the code to run the different models considered in the paper [Valid prediction intervals for regression problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00363)

In the future, further support for conditional conformal prediction might be added. Currently, some functionality is already present, but this is not complete.

## installation

run `create_venv.sh`
This will create a virtual environment in `./venv/` and will install the package in `./src/` with the necessary libraries defined in `requirements.txt`.
Now the files in `./scripts` can be used.
